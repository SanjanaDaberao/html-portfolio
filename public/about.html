<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there myself Sanjana.You can probably me "San/Sun". Well am an Engineer or a web developer, thats what am doing currently right now.
  Well if I talk about my self then am kinda Artistic personality and so the chill and cool one. I love to dance, I mean I'll never get bore from it.
  Its my Passion. Another thing i love to do is sketching or drawing or painting thats my top second faviourt thing to do. Its not just I only love this things,
  but I also love to do new things in my life. Such as writing a song or singing the song even if I know that my voice is not that much of good, but as I say i love to do 
  new things in my life.Recently I started to learn the fashion desiging course cause I love to do that also, and I also started to take the piano lessons so that
  i can create my own song. I really dont like messy things at all. And because of that I always make sure that my stuff is also in the right place and in right health.
  Thats why indirectly or directly I love to managed and maintain and clean the things or enviroment surronded by me.  
</p>

<p>Recently I loose my job. And its kinda big shocked for me cause i was given my best to it. But as everything has its own reasone to happen, at last I stop stressing out
  for the things which is not in my control. It was kind a painful thing but again its not in my control. So i was just so fucking messed up in my life, that i just stop from trying 
and hoping for the best. But thats not even going to work for me . So all I can do is try and give my best.  </p>
